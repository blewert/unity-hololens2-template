# Unity Template for Hololens 2 Projects
A template for creating Unity projects for the Hololens 2. One of the biggest issues I've come across with creating applications for the HL2 with Unity is that there is so much mixed guidance online. Some people say to use OpenXR. Some people say to use Unity's XR plugin management with Windows MR. This confused the hell out of me. So here is a working template for Hololens 2 applications built with Unity 2014.4.11f1. 

## Why?
Because you don't have to worry about settings, and which to use.

## But it's blank?
Yes, it's blank for now. I plan to update this repository with a working template very soon. I've had troubles recently with getting some scene working, so when I find out I'll update this repo.
